The Gabor filter presents a small improvement in the original fingerprint. The application of the Gabor Filter applies a blurred effect in the image, in this way a deblurring method was applied. After that, the image was binarized and thinned by a method of skeletonization. The results presented so far seem promising, although the fingerprint segmentation is still not perfect due to the existing noise. The next step is to extract the features from the input fingerprints and match the recognized fingerprints.
